# Lab Attendance Server

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) based attendance systems are commonly used in various industries to track employee attendance and timekeeping. When integrated with Docker, it can provide a flexible and scalable solution for managing attendance data and analytics.

Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight and portable, making it easier to run applications across different environments. With Docker, RFID based attendance systems can be deployed as containers, which can be easily replicated and managed across different servers and environments.

Here are some key features and benefits of deploying RFID based attendance system on Docker:










## Deployment

To deploy this project run


```bash
docker-compose build
```
```bash
xhost +si:localuser:$USER
```
```bash
xhost +local:docker
```
```bash
export DISPLAY=$DISPLAY
```
```bash
docker-compose up 
```

OR

```bash
./up.sh```

## Benefits

- Scalability: Docker allows you to easily scale your RFID based attendance system by creating multiple containers of the application. This ensures that you can handle any increase in the number of employees or locations where attendance is being recorded.

- Portability: Since containers are self-contained, you can easily move your RFID based attendance system from one environment to another. This means that you can run the same application in a development, testing, or production environment with the same configuration.

- Security: Docker provides isolation between containers, ensuring that each container has its own resources and cannot access resources of other containers. This enhances security by reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

- Efficiency: Docker containers are lightweight, which means that they require fewer resources than traditional virtual machines. This results in faster startup times and better performance for your RFID based attendance system.

- Ease of deployment: With Docker, you can deploy your RFID based attendance system with ease using a single command. This reduces the time and effort required to deploy the application, making it more efficient.
